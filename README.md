# **Hi there, I'm JoÃ£o** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a communication design graduate turned **frontend developer**. My design background helped me develop a keen eye for detail and gave me the tools to communicate effectively with designers. That is where I feel the most comfortable â€” working on the intersection between design and development.

## Technologies I enjoy working with

- HTML, CSS , JavaScript, Svelte, Vue, and React.

## Looking for

- Cool projects to **contribute** to, and **learn** from.

## Work outside GitHub

- [**Website for Nadoki**](https://nadoki.com), a mixing and mastering studio located at Riverside Studios, in the heart of Berlin. This project was developed with **Svelte & Sapper**. The source code is available on this [**GitLab repository**](https://gitlab.com/nadoki/nadoki-website-v2).
