# **Hi there, I'm JoÃ£o** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a communication design graduate turned **frontend developer** currently working at [**Overnice**](https://overnice.com). My design background helped me develop a keen eye for detail and gave me the tools to communicate effectively with designers. That is where I feel the most comfortable â€” working on the intersection between design and development.
