# **Hi there, I'm JoÃ£o** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a communication design graduate turned **frontend developer** currently working at [**Octopus Energy**](https://octopus.energy). My design background helped me develop a keen eye for detail and gave me the tools to communicate effectively with designers. That is where I feel the most comfortable â€” working at the intersection of design and development.
