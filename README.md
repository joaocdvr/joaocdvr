# **Hi there, I'm JoÃ£o** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a communication design graduate turned **frontend developer**. My design background helped me develop a keen eye for detail and gave me the tools to communicate more effectively with designers. That is where I feel the most comfortable â€” working on the intersection between design and development.

## Technologies I enjoy working with

- HTML, CSS , Svelte, and React.

## Looking for

- An **internship/junior** position where I can collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds/expertise, broaden/improve my skills, and grow with a group of people that cares about what they are building;
- Cool projects to **contribute** to, and **learn** from.

## Work outside GitHub

- [**Website for Nadoki**](https://nadoki.com), a mixing and mastering studio located at Riverside Studios, in the heart of Berlin. This project was developed with **Svelte & Sapper**. The source code is available [**here**](https://gitlab.com/nadoki/nadoki-website-v2).
